1.when we want our event to be executed immediately after an incoming connections (or after doing some file manipulation) we should use setImmediate instead of setTimeOut since SetImmediate is located in check phase and incomming connection  is located in I/O phase. Since SetTimeout is located in Timer phase it will be executed much later on.
2. process.nextTick is located in the nextTick queue which gives it priorty of execution than setImmediate which is located in the even queue
3. http, https, stream, fs, OS, http2, url, path, events, buffer,Timers
